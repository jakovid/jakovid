**`Digital Artisan (Developer/Writer/Creator)`**

I am a self-taught software engineer that enjoys experimenting with new technologies, tools, and languages. My life has taken me to some of the largest cities in the world, where I was able to solve a wide variety of problems across multiple industries and tech stacks. After helping the team at `Scale AI` qualify prospective machine learning and software engineering candidates, I am currently working at `Meta Platforms, Inc.` as a `Software Engineer`. I previously spent my freetime working on open source projects as a member of `Mikan Labs`, but life got busy with the arrival of my daughter. Hopefully, I'll have a bit more time to work on side projects from now on.

Beyond coding professionally and casually, I also occasionally create educational JavaScript focused videos over on my YouTube channel in an effort to repay my debt to the tech world that helped me build my skills for free.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Jacob's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I held a variety of analytical focused roles after university. I did database creation and analysis for a legal services company that protected large corporations from those pesky workers that want to be compensated fairly, created industry reports for a financial services company that acted as a third party expert on behalf of banks and companies going public on the Hong Kong Stock Exhange, received a full scholarship to pursue my masters degree focused on official financing competition in African nations between the United States and China, and helped member companies of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

In the summer of 2019, I had the option of working as a consultant for a major law firm in Shanghai, or moving to Taipei to bootstrap a company in the tourism industry. I chose the latter, and discovered programming when I taught myself how to build our website. 2020 was not a great year for a tourism company, but it allowed me to find a career I love. 
since then, I spearheaded the creation a an education company's first bi-lingual website, was invited to be a part of the inaugral batch of rapid prototypers at a venture studio, joined a fellowship to receive mentorship from from senior engineers, interviewed 100+ machine learning and software engineering experts for `Scale AI`, co-founded a team that builds open source projects, and currently work at `Meta Platforms, Inc.` as a `Software Engineer` in the Monetization org.

Life is great, the job market isn't, but that won't stop us. Try your best to stand out, do your best work everyday, and don't be afraid of failure or rejection.
