# üõ´ Jacob Dowdle - Web3 Idiots üõ¨

**`Digital Artisan`**

I am a self-taught software engineer that enjoys experimenting with new technologies, tools, and languages. My life has taken me to some of the largest cities in the world, where I was able to solve a wide variety of software engineering problems across multiple industries and tech stacks. After helping the team at `Scale AI` qualify prospective machine learning and software engineering candidates, the next and hopefully final stop on my journey will be to `Meta Platforms, Inc.` as a `Rotational Engineer`. I am currently spending my freetime working on open source projects as a member of `Mikan Labs` and building `Reclaimia`, a turn-based strategy game I am making with plain old React. (Why plain old React? I was told it was not possible to create a game like this with it. I want to test the validity of that statement.)

Beyond coding professionally and casually, I also occasionally create educational JavaScript focused videos over on my YouTube channel in an effort to repay my debt to the tech world that helped me build my skills for free.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Jacob's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I held a variety of analytical focused roles after university. I did database creation and analysis for a legal services company that protected large corporations from those pesky workers that want to be compensated correctly, created industry reports for a financial services company that acted as a third party expert on behalf of banks and companies going public on the Hong Kong Stock Exhange, and completed a masters degree focused on official financing competition in Africa between the United States and China. In the summer of 2019, I had the option of working as a consultant for a major law firm in Shanghai, or moving to Taipei to bootstrap a company in the tourism industry. I chose the latter, and discovered programming when I taught myself how to build our webiste. 2020 was not a great year for a tourism company, but it allowed me to find a career I love. I have continued to build websites and web apps, joined a fellowship to learn DSA and system design, and co-founded a team that builds open source projects. Life is great, the job market isn't, but that won't stop me. As the youngest in a long line of coal miners, it was my destiny to hashtag learn to code.
